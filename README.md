ABOUT
=================================
My team and I use this server for various mobile apps and web apps. It is very robust
and has served us well. We figured we could share it with the world because it took a long
time to get right.

We hope it helps everyone get their projects of the ground quickly by showing you how to
use the JDBC driver to connect to MYSQL, and Jetty to actually handle the HTTP requests.
We will add HTTPS support as soon as we can abstract our proprietary information from it
and make it available for everyone.

Server was built and contributed by William Falcon, Sam Frank, Michael Ben-Ami. All of us are studying Computer Science at Columbia University in New York.

Enjoy!!
